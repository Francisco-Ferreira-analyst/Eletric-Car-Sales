# Electric Vehicle Population Case Study

## üöó Overview

This case study explores the growth and distribution of **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** across the United States, using a detailed dataset of vehicle registrations. With sustainability and clean energy becoming global priorities, EV adoption has surged, making this a timely and critical analysis of national trends.

### üîç Objective

To uncover patterns in EV adoption, technological advancement, and market share across manufacturers by analyzing the composition, electric range, and geographic spread of EVs.

The study focuses on two key types of electric vehicles:

- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)**
- **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)**

---

## üìä Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analyzed

1. **Total Electric Vehicles**  
   - Combined count of BEVs and PHEVs to determine market size and growth.

2. **Average Electric Range**  
   - Calculated across all vehicles to assess battery efficiency and technological advancement.

3. **Total BEV Vehicles**  
   - Measured both total BEVs and their share of total EVs to highlight the shift toward fully electric models.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles**  
   - Counted total PHEVs and their share of the market for comparative insights.
